# 2BOT: Bot for educational and entretainment purposes.
2BOT is my first bot in which I will be adding funcionality whenever I want.
It started arround 2021 and is entirely writed in Python, language that I was learning in that moment. To be honest, is fully made with copy-paste code from many sources. I didn't really understood how Classes, Modules or Async works. My unique progress until now, Jan 2023, was to add String-builded commands like mathematic calculations and random responses. 

Since 2023, I changed my mind regarding on my developer journey. I decided to understand Javascript before Python because of the ecosystem that means being a Full-Stack Dev, I could understand Backend and Frontend with the same programming language.
